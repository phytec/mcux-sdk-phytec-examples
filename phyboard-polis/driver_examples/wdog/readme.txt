Overview
========
The WDOG Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK wdog driver.
In this example,implemented to test the wdog.
Please notice that because WDOG control registers are write-once only. And
for the field WDT, once software performs a write "1" operation to this bit,
it can not be reset/cleared until the next POR, this bit does not get reset/
cleared due to any system reset. So the WDOG_Init function can be called 
only once after power reset when WDT set, and the WDOG_Disable function can 
be called only once after reset.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
