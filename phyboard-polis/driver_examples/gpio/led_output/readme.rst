Overview
========

The GPIO Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software
to manipulate the general-purpose outputs. The example is supported by the set,
clear, and toggle write-only registers for each port output data register. The
example take turns to shine the LED.

Hardware requirements
=====================
