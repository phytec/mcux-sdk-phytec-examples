Overview
========
The TMU example shows how to configure TMU register to monitor and report the temperature from
the temperature measurement site located on the chip.

Note: This application can't run with a running linux on the A-cores since the
tmu is already in use.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you will see the temperature output from the terminal.
